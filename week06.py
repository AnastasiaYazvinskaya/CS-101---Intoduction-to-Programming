                       A dinner
                       
It was a %s, cold November day. I woke up to the %s smell 
of %s roasting in the %s downstairs. I %s down the 
stairs to see if I could help to %s the dinner. My mom said, 
"See if %s needs a fresh %s." So I carried a tray of 
glasses full of %s into the %s room. When I got there, I 
couldn't believe my %s! There were %s %s on the %s!
